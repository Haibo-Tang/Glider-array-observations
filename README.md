# Glider-array-observations
cooperative observation of multiple gliders 


Submesoscale processes with spatial scales of 0.1-10 km are recognized as important for cross-scale energy transport and vertical heat transport in the upper ocean. However, there has been little exploration of how submesoscale turbulence evolves during extreme weather such as tropical cyclones, especially through in situ observations. 

We analyze the characteristics of submesoscale instability within the mesoscale anticyclone of Tropical Cyclone  as it passes through the South China Sea using collaborative observations from multiple gliders.

You can use "Glider-array-observations" to look at the submesoscale processes during TC, the code for each subgraph, and the data provided.

Note: The file data and the code must be compiled using Matlab.
